## Object Design Choices and Object Model

Since we need to build a system that is both **strong** and highly **scalable**, we really need to analyze and design our object model carefully. From our perspectives, there are **THREE** strategies to safely construct a robust and highly OO object model:

1. Extract every possible and potential "thing" (i.e. object) in the project to reduce the dependences between modules.
2. Separate the data read-write processes from the main project logics (and the objects).
3. Separate the **backend** functions from **frontend** ones (i.e. **never mix backend with frontend!**). We make each GUI window as a class, and call relevent methods of the objects together with launch data reads-and-writes in the button listener classes of it (i.e. the specific GUI window class).

Based on that, we have formed a clear blueprint of the object design of this project. We have implemented **THREE** main components to handle different types of requests throughout the project, namely **BankAttributes**, **Data**, and **GUI**. They exist as **packages** in Java.

- **Package BankAttributes** contains all the base classes of the project, such as Manager.java, Customer.java, Currency.java, etc. Each class represents an essential object of the project. For instance, the project will definitely involve a manager and receive a lot of customers duing its runtime, thus rendering a manager class and a customer class a must.
- **Package Data** contains all the classes that are related to data reads-and-writes. For example, when the player of the project creates a new customer, relevent data (e.g. username and password) should be written into the database in order to persist all the data from last run. 
- **Package GUI** is responsible for managing all the elements of the GUI windows of the project. It serves as a "**middleman**" to connect both itself and the previous two packages! 

Allow us to describe the customer login scenario to better your understanding. For example, in the GUI customer login window (i.e. **GUICustomerLogin.java**), once the player has entered the correct username and password and hit the "login" button, the program will automatically launch the **read method** in **CustomerDataManager.java** of the **Data Package** and read all the account information of that particular customer. Afterwards, a customer object will be created by the **Customer.java** class of the **BankAttributes Package** and instantiated by the corresponding information just read.

In this way, we have successfully created a pre-existing customer "from scratch"! 

But in fact, this is a brand new customer object that is just created after the player hits the login button. It is just that the newly created customer has all the relevent data of a particular record in our customer database.

This is the **magic** of our aforementioned **THREE** strategies to ensure a robust and highly scalable (and extendable) object model.

We will explain the purposes of each class in the **THREE** components (i.e. packages) in the next part.

## Object and GUI Relationship

As a matter of fact, the relationship between GUI and all the objects has already been introduced (in detail) in the first part of this document. 

The **GUI Package** serves as a **"middleman"** to connect itself to the other two packages (i.e. **objects** and **data**). We think this is a very reasonable way of system design since we will only launch the login function of a customer and load all her/his account information after the "login" GUI button is clicked.

---

## Benefits of Our Object Design

The **BIGGEST** benefit of our object design strategy is **FAST**!

For a bank manager, time is gold, time is money! As the development group hired by the bank manager, time is the ultimate pursue of both our program running speed and our development speed!

By implementing the aforementioned **THREE** components, no matter we are in which GUI class, we can easily build connections to our database to retrieve and inject data to our newly created object from the base class component.

Another huge benefit of our object design strategy is **FOOLPROOF**!

Since we have modularized every possible and potential object from the project, it is very straightforward for us to trace bugs. For instance, if the **deposit** feature of the customers is anomalous, we can quickly pinpoint the **deposit()** method of the **Customer.java** class (**BankAttributes Package**) and relevent **write()** method of **CustomerDataManager.java** class (**Data Package**).

---

## Work Division of Group Members

We feel very lucky that the two of us are both very **responsible** and **prompt**!

- **Tian Yu** is responsible for developing all **frontend** features (i.e. all classes in the **GUI Package**) and implementing all the colorful and graphic elements to our project.
- **Dayong Wu** is responsible for developing all **backend** features (i.e. all classes in the **BankAttributes Package** and **Data Package**) and relating them to their relavent GUI classes (i.e. **Object and GUI Relationship!**)
- Both of us have participated in the development of the **stock feature** of our project.
- Both of us have participated in the writing of both this document and the **ReadMe** file.

We also play as program testers for each other, which is very helpful for eliminating bugs! We all know "**those closely involved cannot see clearly**", therefore this is a very good practice for us to grow more experiences on detecting bugs.

---

## Appendix

We are very proud of some of our **GUI design drafts** for this project and we think they deserve a "booth" in this document :)
